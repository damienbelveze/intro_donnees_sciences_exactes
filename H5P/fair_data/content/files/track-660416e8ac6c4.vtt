00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.660
The secure storage and sharing of
research data is increasingly being

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.920
emphasized by research funders and
institutions.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.080
The benefits of sharing research
data include enabling new discovery

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.560
using existing datasets,
exploring new collaborations,

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.520
the verification of results and
reducing duplication of research.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.900
The FAIR data principles act as
an international guideline for

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.460
high-quality data stewardship.

8
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.140
FAIR is an acronym which makes the
concept easier to discuss,

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.860
and FAIR data refers to data which
meet principles of findability,

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.620
accessibility, interoperability
and reusability.

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.620
By itself, data has no inherent meaning.

12
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.940
For data to have meaning and be usable,
useful and valuable, it needs to

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.120
adhere to certain standards.

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
The FAIR data principles were first
specified in 2016 in a publication

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440
by an international consortium of
researchers.

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.220
Without a set of guidelines like
the FAIR the world of research data

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.120
would become more siloed,
restrictive and inaccessible than

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.080
ever before.

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.680
The FAIR data principles guide
researchers in managing their data

20
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.200
and making it findable,
accessible, interoperable and reusable.

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.200
Using an established data repository
like UWC's institutional repository,

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.300
KeKapu, to store and share research
data goes a long way to ensure that

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.780
it is FAIR.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.800
Making use of a repository like
KeKapu also increases the fairness

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.380
of the data because it requires
that data are richly described and

26
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.520
accompanied by supporting documentation.

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.520
UWC is also committed to data being
as open as possible and as closed

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.540
as necessary.

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.440
Open in order to foster reusability
and to accelerate research.

30
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.020
Closed to safeguard the privacy
of the subjects.

31
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.460
Ideally, all data should be supplied
in open formats where possible and

32
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.720
published openly, where legally
and ethically permissible.

33
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.620
The first step in reusing data is
to find them.

34
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.800
Metadata and data should be easy
to find for both humans and computers.

35
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.220
Machine-readable metadata are essential
for automatic discovery of datasets

36
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.740
and services, so this is an essential
component of the verification process.

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.840
For data to be findable,
metadata and metadata are assigned

38
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.580
a globally unique and persistent
identifier.

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.360
Data are described with rich metadata.

40
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.840
Metadata clearly and explicitly
include the identifier of the data

41
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.800
it describes.

42
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.000
Metadata and data are registered
or indexed in a searchable resource.

43
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.380
Once the required data have been found,
it needs to be clear how they can

44
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.080
be accessed, possibly including
authentication and authorization.

45
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.640
For data to be accessible,
metadata and data are retrievable

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.460
by the identifier using a standardized
communications protocol.

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.040
The protocol is open,
free and universally implementable

48
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620
and the protocol allows for an
authentication and authorization

49
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.100
procedure where necessary.

50
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.920
Metadata are accessible even when
the data are no longer available.

51
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.900
The data usually need to be integrated
with other data.

52
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.660
In addition, the data need to
interoperate with applications or

53
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.260
workflows for analysis,
storage and processing.

54
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.220
For data to be interoperable,
metadata and data use a formal,

55
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.900
accessible, shared and broadly
applicable language for knowledge

56
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.860
representation.

57
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.100
Metadata and data use vocabularies
that follow FAIR principles.

58
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.860
Metadata and data include qualified
references to other metadata and data.

59
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.000
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to
optimize the reuse of data.

60
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.120
To achieve this, metadata and data
should be well described so that

61
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.380
they can be replicated and or combined
in different settings.

62
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.040
For data to be reusable,
metadata and data are richly described

63
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.180
with a plurality of accurate and
relevant attributes.

64
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.900
Metadata and data are released with
a clear and accessible data usage

65
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.120
license and they are associated
with detailed provenance.

66
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.440
Lastly, metadata and data meet domain
relevant community standards.

67
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.300
Importantly, FAIR data is not a
goal but a process.

68
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.700
Being committed to FAIR data requires
a paradigm shift from individuals

69
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.380
as well as hand-in-hand with FAIR
data compliance comes a commitment

70
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.520
from researchers to research data
management as well as data management

71
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.480
planning.
