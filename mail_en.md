Dear Prof. Armand,

I'm enclosing the data collected this year by our various sensors installed on the Tydale as part of your study "Growth of glane silure catfish *silurus glanis* in european river, the case of the Tydale river". 
Funds from the Royal Fisheries Corporation (RFC) enabled the purchase of 8 underwater sensors along the Tydale, which, when properly parameterized, were able to count only fish weighing over 10 kg. Thanks to the camera's artificial intelligence, catfish were counted with a margin of error of around 3%. 
We have noted certain incidents in the data obtained that could affect the proper conduct of the study. 
In February and May, we noted that some sensors were no longer working properly and had to be repaired. In October, the centralized results collection system broke down for 11 days, causing us to lose data. 
In addition, we pointed out that boating activities on the Tyndale River on certain days in June and July could disturb the catfish, which were therefore less likely to be present on those days. 

I hope that these figures will nevertheless enable you to progress your study and submit your publication before spring. 

Best wishes for the rest of the day, 

Mickael. J. Bernache, Biodiversity Research Institute of Portland
