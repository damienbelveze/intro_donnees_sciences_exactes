We categorized types of DAS. We surveyed corresponding authors who wrote in DAS that they would share the data. A consent to participate in the study was sought for all included manuscripts. After accessing raw data sets, we checked whether data were available in a way that enabled re-analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Of 3556 analyzed articles, 3416 contained DAS. The most frequent DAS category (42\%) indicated that the datasets are available on reasonable request. Among 1792 manuscripts in which DAS indicated that authors are willing to share their data, 1670 (93\%) authors either did not respond or declined to share their data with us. Among 254 (14\%) of 1792 authors who responded to our query for data sharing, only 122 (6.8\%) provided the requested data.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Even when authors indicate in their manuscript that they will share data upon request, the compliance rate is the same as for authors who do not provide DAS, suggesting that DAS may not be sufficient to ensure data sharing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Computational reproducibility is a simple premise in theory, but is difficult to achieve in practice. Building upon past efforts and proposals to maximize reproducibility and rigor in bioinformatics, we present a framework called the five pillars of reproducible computational research. These include (1) literate programming, (2) code version control and sharing, (3) compute environment control, (4) persistent data sharing and (5) documentation. These practices will ensure that computational research work can be reproduced quickly and easily, long into the future. This guide is designed for bioinformatics data analysts and bioinformaticians in training, but should be relevant to other domains of study.}
